# ALM_Test
Repository of Develop Tools Test Sample Code.

In order to report test results from "Test Env Runner" we have to implement extraction of test results generated by build tools. Those should be gathered in our internal data structure which will be later on used for reporting.

**Maven**

Both **Surefire** and **Failsafe** Plugin are used during the test phase of the build lifecycle of maven to execute the tests of an application. It generates reports in two different file formats:

    Plain text files (*.txt)
    XML files (*.xml)

By default, these files are generated at ${basedir}/target/surefire-reports and ${basedir}/target/failsafe-reports accordingly

**Gradle**

Gradle's test runner is highly configurable, but by default test artifacts should be stored in $buildDir/reports/tests.

The Test task generates the following results by default.

    An HTML test report.

    The results in an XML format that is compatible with the Ant JUnit report task. This format is supported by many other tools, such as CI servers.

    Results in an efficient binary format. The task generates the other results from these binary results.
 
Futher, **JUnit** and **TestNG** are used as testing frameworks here for both the build tools.
